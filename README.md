Roman Culture now has access to a unique building
**Completed**


**Events**
*Implemented but not functional*
Neo-Gaul - a non Breton Celtic culture should become Neo-Gaul if occupying a Latin or Germanic cultured province within France, Aquitaine or Celtiberia. Both the culture and character flip (like Norman) MTTH 2400 months
*Implemented but not functional*

Sicily - Norman style, but for Italian/Occitan/Roman (Italo-Sicilian) Byzantine (Greco-Sicilian) MTTH 2400 months

Roman Culture - the Emperor of Rome should have his culture flip to Roman as long as his capital is Roma. Have the event's option read "I [i]am[/i] a true Roman." MTTH 60 months

Titular Title of "Empire of Conquest" - 
If this title doesn't exist, and a character is brave, proud, greedy, not lowborn, and has no emperor level titles, they can be hit by this rare event. The name is dynasty based (like Muslim/Zoroastrian rulers) and grants an invasion CB on all titles held by anyone. MTTH 2400 months (half for pagans). There's also a twin event to destroy the title if its holder is not brave, proud or greedy, MTTH 12 months for second event

**Norse culture**
The Nose culture should have events that make it flip (like the Normans) for many cultures
-All Celtic populations should flip to Norse-Gaels (MTTH 1200)
-West Germanic should flip to Anglo-Norse (MTTH 2400)
-Anglo-Saxon/Anglo-Norse should flip Scottish provinces to Scots (West Germanic group) (MTTH 1200)


**Samaritans**
As a pagan of any kind, there will be a small chance of getting an event that will turn you into a "Samaritan" culture if your capital is on a province of a different (non-pagan) faith. Your religion changes to the province's, but you become a unique "Samaritan" heresy of the faith

NOTE: The Samaritans were Babylonian Pagans who were settled in Judea, when they suffered natural disasters and crop failures, the Babylonian Crown told them the solution was to adopt the gods of the region they settled, thus adopting a pagan-Jew hybrid faith.

All "Samaritan" Heresies should be unique to the monotheistic religion and not to the pagan religion. All should have the ability to found religious heads (like Zoroastrians). All "Samaritan" cultures should be linked to the pagan faith they came from (pagan religions are ethnically linked anyway).

+++Names for Samaritan Religions
*Jesusite (Catholic Heresy) Jesus is the only God (though still Trinitarian) but there are several lesser deities which rule various animistic divine realms as dukes to Christ's kingship. (Can create "Pope of Jesus," faith holds their version of the Blot including human sacrifice, and their pope calls crusades)
*Pantheon of Christ (Orthodox Heresy) Christ is of one body with two natures, a divine and a human one, but they reject the idea of the Trinity in favour of the idea of a multitude of different forms of the one God, which are themselves gods, a "Pantheon of One." (Patriarch system like Orthodox with the ability to create their own Ecumenical Patriarch, and they have a permanent casus belli against all other Christian faiths as well as heathens so long as their ecumenical patriarch exists, but have no access to Holy War CB unless the EP exists)
*Alexandrism (Miaphysite heresy) Christ is of one body and one nature, but that nature is both fully divine and fully human. However, there are other people who had dual human/divine natures, although nobody other than Christ was fully divine.  Other divine humans include John the Baptist, all the apostles,  several other early Christians and many Christianised pagan deities. Alexandrists believe that devout faithful can become "touched" by this divine nature and become partially divine themselves. (Can create an Alexandrist Pope of Alexandria, and very pious individuals can ask this pope to be declared of a "Touched Nature," which grants a trait that gives +30 relations to all other Alexandrists.  Alexandrists can declare Holy Wars, but their pope calls no crusades)
*Hadithi (Sunni Heresy) "There is no god *above* Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger" is the declaration of faith for Hadithis. They worship several minor gods below their principle Abrahmic God. They are known as Hadithi from their reliance on hadiths as their primary source of jurisprudence, of which they have 514 (404 not found in any other Islamic denominations). (Regular Islamic gameplay rules. In addition they may create the Hadithi Caliph. Caliph is unlanded, unlandable and must be castrated. Succession, however, is set by the Caliph's de jure liege, the count of Mecca, as if it was a free investiture Catholic bishopric, only castrated Hadithi men are eligible.  Hadithi have the intrigue ability to castrate themselves, Hadithis view castrated individuals as being +25, with "church view on Castrated" being an additional +25. AI should be set to self-castrate if dynasty decadence is above 50%)
*Azizism (Shia Heresy) Followers of the "13 Imam" Aziz Aziz, Azizists believe that Allah is divided into many divine beings, many of whom walk the earth. Additionally, Azizists believe that Allah is only present in Azizists, and that all non-Azizists are possessed by demons, that Azizists need not obey the laws of non-Azizists, including marital laws. (Azizists follow normal Muslim rules, except are unable to marry non-Azizists, have a -100 penalty to relations with non-Azizist lieges, and can ceremonially rape female prisoners over the age of 14 to impregnate them. Children born this way have the "child of Aziz" trait which acts like Child of Concubine, they can also choose to freely castrate their male children until the age of 14 if they deem them unworthy)
*Mithraic Zoroastrianism (Zoroastrian Heresy) Mithra has been elevated to the level of Ahura-Mazda, and several other gods are worshipped below them. (All the same rules as Zoroastrianism except there's no option for Shaosaynt. Mithraic Zoroastrians can gain a handful of martial traits from intrigue decisions, and view lieges with martial career paths favourably)

**Resurrecting Religions**
As a pagan of any kind, there will be a very small chance to be given the option of resurrecting a pagan pantheon that was native to each de jure kingdom, if the character's capital lies within the kingdom and the pagan faith does not exist.

All pagan faiths should be reformable and have something special about them.

**Witches**

Concept
After resurrecting the appropriate paganism (Celtic, Norse or Hellenic), an unmarried female character has a rare chance to become a witch if no other witches exist.  Witches start out with a "level 1" witch trait, and can improve it up to "level 3." Different witch "levels" grant different levels of monthly piety and allow more options for witchy mayhem. Only girls under the age of 16 can be turned into witches, and only by a frequent education (when they are being educated by a witch) event that also turns them into homosexuals. Witches cannot marry.



Witch Powers

The below would be from a choice event that triggers once the diplomacy option of "cast spell" is used on a character. Initiating the option requires a piety investment, and each option drains piety further

Jinx - adds trait that halves MTTH of all bad/unlucky events
Curse - adds trait "cursed" which makes bad curse events fire frequently. All curse events are tied to your traits. 
Enchant - gives a bonus of some kind to a character.  The bonus will "mature" into another, permanent trait by an event that also removes the temporary "enchanted" trait. Enchantments can grant immortality, superhuman abilities, magical wealth, etc.
Steal Seed - a Witch can also become impregnated with the child of any male character she casts her spell on.

The witches will also have intrigue decision options unique to them

Bear Child of Conquerer - Gives the witch the option of bearing the child of any of the following leaders, and therefore inheriting their heritable claims
-Caesar (Rome/Byzantium)
-Alexander (Greece/Middle East/Persia)
-Genghis Khan (Titular titles of Ilkhanate and Golden Horde)
-Charlemagne (The Karling Realms)
-The Umayyad Guy that fled to Al-Andalus. The Falcon of Arabia... (Umayyad Caliphate)

Drain her youth - selects a random female prisoner and gives you 3 options each costing more piety than the last, each with a 1% chance to do the reverse, and a 2% chance to do double
-drain 10 years of her life to de-age 5
-drain 20 years of her life to de-age 10
-drain 50 years of her life to de-age 25

*Curse Ideas*
Zealous - Character becomes a heresy of their faith, and gains heresiarch. The heresy they become should be one reserved for this event (Arian for Catholics) to ensure that they are alone (or close to it) in their religious beliefs.  Make sure to flesh out all heresies used to have the ability to create a religious head (like Zoroastrians). Event text is written as though when your character went to sleep, their heresy was dominant, and are now confused as to why everyone is following a long dead heresy. Pagans just become "Pagan"

Cynical - "No Afterlife" kills character, event text explains how you always expressed doubts about the afterlife, then you're hit in the head by a rock and killed.  The acknowledgement text is "Ha! I told you nothing comes after..."

Greedy - event that takes away 10,000 gold. Text explains how you wake up owing everyone money and can't explain it

Humble - "The Book of Job" event, equal chance of getting ill, infirm, incapable, blind, eunich, wounded, maimed

Proud - "(yourname), I am your father" character's dynasty changes to bastard dynasty and gains bastard trait. Event is that you come along an old man who looks exactly like you and he is introduced as a "friend" of your mother's.

Strong - de-age 100 years

Weak - age 100 years

Genius - become imbicile

Quick - become slow

Attractive - become ugly

Slow - become imbicile

Imbicile - lose imbicile. Event is "Flowers for Algernon" and triggers a second event that gives the imbicile trait back along with Broken Spirit.

Inbred Freak - become married to close relative (mother, father, brother, sister, etc) end current marriage if necessary

Ugly - marriage ends, given modifier that gives all close kin -200 relations with you

Lustful (male) - castration

Lustful (female) - impregnated with child from ugly weak imbicile dwarf hunchback clubfoot stutterer lisp inbred freak 

*Protecting yourself from witches*
Witches should be unable to cast spells against characters of very high (25+) learning.  For rulers, having a court chaplain with 25+ learning should also grant this immunity.

If a character has the jinxed or cursed trait, and their court chaplain is of learning 18+, there should be an event that can fire which removes jinxed and cursed from the character and grants the court chaplain the "witch hunter" trait. The event's MTTH should be reduced by each point of learning over 18 and be reduced by the "mystic" trait and the "witch hunter" trait

Witch hunter should also be acquirable from an event that can fire for Mystics
